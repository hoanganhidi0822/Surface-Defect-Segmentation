# Surface-Defect-Segmentation

Welcome to the Surface-Defect-Segmentation repository! This project focuses on automating the process of detecting and measuring defects caused by nailers on wood surfaces using image segmentation techniques.

## Overview

Traditionally, workers must manually measure the size of defects on wood surfaces using rulers, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Each wood surface can have hundreds of defected spots, requiring hours to measure accurately.

This project aims to streamline this process by using image segmentation to automatically detect and measure the size of all defects on a wood surface with just a single click. This not only saves time but also increases accuracy and efficiency in quality control.

## Features

- **Automated Defect Detection**: The system automatically identifies defects on wood surfaces caused by nailers.
- **Size Measurement**: Each detected defect is accurately measured, providing the dimensions without manual intervention.
- **One-Click Operation**: Users can analyze an entire wood surface and obtain measurements for all defects with a single click.
- **High Efficiency**: Significantly reduces the time required for inspection from hours to minutes, improving productivity in quality control processes.
- **Scalable**: Can be adapted for different types of wood surfaces and defect patterns.
